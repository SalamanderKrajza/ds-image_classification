# Introduction
As we've already tested how xception network works with another dataset to clafify what is on image - next step is to determine where it is or what else is here.

Depending on goal of project, we may need different dataset and different model responses. This may not be obvious and to pciture this, below is a part of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02145 article that contains few examples what we may want to extract from image

However, as even finding or creating dataset may be challenging, we will aproach this one step at the time.

# Next steps:
## Get dataset with localized objects to work with
## Select and prepare them do desired format to create POC with known architecture
## Analyze outputs
## Consider expanding project
### More target classes?
### More objects at same time?
### More advanced networks architectures?
### Different output (image segmentation)?
